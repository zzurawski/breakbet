# Betting App

## Description
Here is a fun betting app utilizing React Native frontend and a python/mysql backend. Once complete
this app should be able to log user info by signup and then be able to remember said user in a database.
Once logged in, the user should be able to place bets and be able to parlay said bets.

1. (fake) money won / in account
2. be able to wager fake money through the users account
3. odds and that stacking of odds in parlays
